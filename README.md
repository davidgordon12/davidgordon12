### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David Gordon

* ðŸ“š I'm always learning new technologies, languages, frameworks and areas of development!
* ðŸ›  Taking things apart is one of my passions! Just don't ask me how they go back together ðŸ‘€
* ðŸŽ¥ I love helping out others, take a look at my YouTube and maybe you'll learn something new.

When I was a kid my family was always into technology. My father would be fixing close friends and familys TVs, Computers, and anything else that had electricity running through it. From a young age I was exposed to computers, where I inherited the love for tinkering and understanding the mechanical components of whatever it was I was playing with. Eventually, when I was still in elemntary school, I had the desire to make my own games, apps or websites, for whatever I was into at the time. I started out in Python, then in highschool I took classes using Java, and in college it was C#. Today, I've used more languages than I can count and both hands, and I'm still going!

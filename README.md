### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>   My name is David. I'm a student at Conestoga College and love to create and learn. Programming is a perfect avenue for both of my passions, and so I spend lot's of my time creating software and web applications alike. I've spent the majority of my time developing creating Full-Stack web apps, or Desktop applications, mainly using C#, and .NET Core. <br /> <br /> 
  However, Web Dev isn't my only interest. I have a strong desire to learn low-level concepts, such as how CPU's read and execute instructions, or how Operating Systems work. I think these are really important concepts, especially in the modern day, where the world is powered by computers. <br /> <br /> 
  My future goal is to create my own simple OS with very limited but real-world functionality, like having a file system, and other built-in proccesses.

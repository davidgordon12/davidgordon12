### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David Gordon

* ðŸ“š I'm always learning new technologies, languages, frameworks and areas of development!
* ðŸ›  Taking things apart is one of my passions! Just don't ask me how they go back together ðŸ‘€
* ðŸŽ¥ I love helping out others, take a look at my YouTube and maybe you'll learn something new.

From a young age I was exposed to computers, where I inherited the love for tinkering and understanding the mechanical components of whatever it was I was playing with from my father. When I was still in elemntary school, I had the desire to make my own games, apps or websites, for whatever I was into at the time. I started out using Python making 2D games for fun to show off to my family. Today, I've used more languages than I can count and both hands, and I'm still going!
